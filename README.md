# ns8-hermes-agent

`ns8-hermes-agent` is an NS8 module that packages two services into one manageable deployment:

- [Hermes-Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent), which provides the per-agent runtime and gateway used by each configured assistant
- [OpenViking](https://github.com/volcengine/OpenViking), which provides the shared multi-tenant backend those agents use for retrieval, indexing, and tenant-scoped workspace data

In practical terms, this project exists so an NS8 administrator can define and run multiple Hermes agents from a single module, while reusing one shared OpenViking service behind the scenes instead of standing up a separate backend stack for every agent.

The module handles the NS8-specific work needed to make that usable in production: it stores the agent roster in module configuration, provisions tenant data inside OpenViking, generates per-agent runtime files and secrets, manages rootless Podman containers through systemd user units, discovers cluster smarthost settings, and exposes an embedded admin UI for day-to-day configuration.

This repository is therefore not a generic Hermes application or an upstream OpenViking deployment. It is the integration layer that ties them together for NethServer 8, with the current checked-in tree as the source of truth.

Older docs in this repository may still describe a larger Hermes manager architecture. When in doubt, follow the current implementation described below.

## Current code state

- module image built by `build-images.sh` and labeled with two dependent wrapper images under `containers/`
- custom actions: `create-module`, `configure-module`, `get-configuration`, and `destroy-module`
- `configure-module` validates an `agents` payload, stores `AGENTS_LIST` in `environment`, synchronizes shared and per-agent runtime files, and reconciles per-agent systemd targets
- the module now runs one shared rootless OpenViking container per module instance, while each started agent gets one rootless Hermes runtime container in gateway mode managed by its own systemd target
- the module also keeps one reserved always-on Hermes runtime for the shared OpenViking backend; it is backend-managed, hidden from the UI, and not removable through normal agent operations
- each started agent gets one internal named Podman volume mounted at Hermes `/opt/data`, and the module also keeps one shared OpenViking named volume mounted at `/app/data` for the shared multi-tenant OpenViking server
- those named volumes are internal to the module for now; the image does not yet declare `org.nethserver.volumes` for NS8 disk-placement integration
- the module image requests one NS8-managed TCP port at install time; `create-module` persists that allocation into `OPENVIKING_PORT` for the shared OpenViking localhost publish mapping
- `get-configuration` returns the configured agents parsed from `AGENTS_LIST` and reports actual runtime status from systemd
- smarthost discovery helper plus a `smarthost-changed` handler that refreshes active per-agent targets
- embedded Vue 2 and Vue CLI admin UI with `status`, `settings`, and `about` views; `settings` now manages agents from the NS8 module UI
- the current implementation does not publish an external HTTP route
- Robot Framework tests under `tests/`

## Repository layout

- `imageroot/` contains the current NS8 actions, helper script, event handler, and user systemd unit.
- `ui/` contains the embedded Vue 2 and Vue CLI application.
- `containers/` contains thin component image wrappers for Hermes and OpenViking.
- `tests/` contains the Robot Framework suite and Python test dependencies.

See `STRUCTURE.md` for a file-by-file map.

## Build

Build the module image and the component images with:

```bash
bash build-images.sh
```

The script uses:

- `REPOBASE`, default `ghcr.io/nethserver`
- `IMAGETAG`, default `latest`

`IMAGETAG` is normalized so branch names that contain `/` still produce valid image tags.

## UI development

The module UI lives in `ui/` and is built into `/ui` inside the module image.

For local UI work:

```bash
cd ui
yarn install
yarn serve
```

To build the production UI bundle:

```bash
cd ui
yarn install
yarn build
```

If your shell does not already provide it, set `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` before running the UI toolchain.

## Install

Instantiate the module with:

    add-module ghcr.io/nethserver/hermes-agent:latest 1

The output of the command will return the instance name.
Output example:

    {"module_id": "hermes-agent1", "image_name": "hermes-agent", "image_url": "ghcr.io/nethserver/hermes-agent:latest"}

The current checked-in refactor covers fresh installs only. No in-place upgrade
path from the older split Hermes plus gateway runtime is shipped in this tree.

Fresh installs receive one NS8-allocated `TCP_PORT`. The module copies that
value into `OPENVIKING_PORT` during `create-module` so the shared OpenViking
service keeps a stable module-local environment contract while NS8 owns the
actual port reservation. During later runtime reconciliation, the module will
also repair a missing `OPENVIKING_PORT` from `TCP_PORT` once if needed.

## Configure

Let's assume that the hermes-agent instance is named `hermes-agent1`.

The current settings UI and `configure-module` action manage an array of
user-facing agents plus one shared OpenViking embedding configuration. The
reserved system Hermes backend is returned by `get-configuration` with hidden
protected, and system flags, but it is filtered out of the visible UI and
cannot be deleted through normal saves.

Each user-facing agent contains:

- `id`: integer starting from `1`
- `name`: user-defined string with allowed characters `[A-Za-z ]`
- `role`: one of `default` or `developer`
- `status`: one of `start` or `stop`; it is persisted and used to decide whether
    the per-agent systemd target should be running
- `use_default_gateway_for_llm`: boolean; when `true`, the agent runtime is
    configured to use the module's hidden shared Hermes API gateway as its main
    LLM endpoint
- hidden backend-only fields `account`, `user`, and `agent_id`: these are
    auto-generated today, persisted with the roster, and used to provision the
    agent inside the shared OpenViking server

The persisted runtime value is stored in `environment` as:

    AGENTS_LIST=1:Foo Bar:developer:start:agent-1:agent-1:agent-1:true,2:Alice User:default:stop:agent-2:agent-2:agent-2:false

Example:

    api-cli run module/hermes-agent1/configure-module --data '{"agents":[{"id":1,"name":"Foo Bar","role":"developer","status":"start","use_default_gateway_for_llm":true}],"openviking":{"embedding":{"provider":"jina","api_key":"test-key"}}}'

The above command will:
- validate and store the agent roster in `environment`
- persist the shared OpenViking embedding provider in `environment` and its API key in `secrets.env`
- synchronize `systemd.env`, one shared `openviking.conf`, and per-agent `agent-<id>.env` and `agent-<id>_secrets.env` runtime files
- synchronize the reserved system Hermes runtime files `agent-0.env` and `agent-0_secrets.env`
- prefer `hermes config set ...` inside each agent volume for Hermes-native model settings so opted-in agents keep `config.yaml` and `.env` aligned with the hidden shared gateway endpoint and key
- remove per-agent runtime files for stopped or deleted agents
- generate and preserve one shared `OPENVIKING_ROOT_API_KEY` in `secrets.env`
- generate and preserve one reserved Hermes API server key for the hidden system backend in `agent-0_secrets.env`
- provision one OpenViking account and admin user per started agent and store that tenant user key as `OPENVIKING_API_KEY` in `agent-<id>_secrets.env`
- provision the reserved system Hermes tenant so the always-on backend can use the shared OpenViking instance too
- generate `systemd.env` with only the controlled image variables needed by systemd units, including the internal shared OpenViking host port
- rely on the NS8-allocated `TCP_PORT` copied to `OPENVIKING_PORT` during `create-module` instead of self-reserving the shared OpenViking publish port at runtime
- start or stop the matching `hermes-agent@<id>.target` instances based on the saved status
- keep `hermes-agent-hermes-system.service` running as the dedicated OpenViking VLM backend
- create or clean the matching per-agent Hermes named volumes as containers are started or removed
- keep the shared OpenViking volume and shared server runtime outside the per-agent targets

The generated shared `openviking.conf` now contains:

- a fixed `vlm` block that points to the reserved Hermes API server over the module-internal loopback publish path
- an optional `embedding.dense` block generated from the saved embedding provider and API key

Changing the embedding service later is allowed at configuration level, but it
does not migrate existing vectors inside the shared OpenViking workspace. If you
switch providers later, clear or rebuild the shared indexed data to avoid
dimension mismatches or mixed embedding spaces.

Read the current configuration with:

    api-cli run module/hermes-agent1/get-configuration --data '{}'

Example output:

    {"agents": [{"id": 0, "name": "OpenViking Backend", "role": "default", "status": "start", "account": "system", "user": "system", "agent_id": "openviking-backend", "use_default_gateway_for_llm": false, "hidden": true, "protected": true, "system": true}, {"id": 1, "name": "Foo Bar", "role": "developer", "status": "start", "account": "agent-1", "user": "agent-1", "agent_id": "agent-1", "use_default_gateway_for_llm": true, "hidden": false, "protected": false, "system": false}], "openviking": {"embedding": {"provider": "jina", "api_key_configured": true}}}

`status` is returned from the actual systemd-backed runtime state, not only from
the desired configuration.

Started agents enable a templated user target named `hermes-agent@<id>.target`.
That target brings up one per-agent Hermes runtime service in gateway mode,
while all agents share one OpenViking service and the reserved system backend
uses its own dedicated service:

- `hermes-agent-openviking.service`
- `hermes-agent-hermes@<id>.service`
- `hermes-agent-hermes-system.service`

The persistent storage contract is currently:

- `hermes-agent-hermes@<id>.service` mounts `hermes-agent-hermes-data-<id>` at `/opt/data`
- `hermes-agent-openviking.service` mounts the shared volume `hermes-agent-openviking-data` at `/app/data`
- `hermes-agent-openviking.service` bind-mounts the generated shared `openviking.conf` to `/app/ov.conf`
- `hermes-agent-hermes-system.service` mounts `hermes-agent-hermes-data-0` at `/opt/data` and publishes the Hermes API server only on module-local loopback for OpenViking

The Hermes wrapper keeps the upstream Hermes Docker entrypoint and now defaults
directly to `gateway run`. Upstream Hermes still owns first-start bootstrap for
`/opt/data`, while the module may pre-seed `.env` and `config.yaml` with
`hermes config set` before service startup for agents that opt into the shared
LLM gateway. This keeps the Hermes home in one volume without splitting runtime
state across two containers.

When `use_default_gateway_for_llm` is enabled for a user-facing agent, the
module keeps using the hidden reserved backend as the only shared gateway
server. The opted-in agent is configured as a client of that internal endpoint;
it does not become a gateway server itself and it does not change the meaning of
the visible `default` role.

## Smarthost setting discovery

Some settings are discovered from Redis rather than passed through the
`configure-module` input. The helper `imageroot/bin/discover-smarthost`
writes public SMTP settings into `environment` and `SMTP_PASSWORD` into
`secrets.env`. The helper `imageroot/bin/sync-agent-runtime` then copies only
the agent-specific runtime data into `agent-<id>.env` and
`agent-<id>_secrets.env`, and writes one shared `openviking.conf` plus
`systemd.env`. `OPENVIKING_PORT` is seeded earlier by `create-module` from the
NS8-managed `TCP_PORT`, so runtime reconciliation only consumes that persisted
value. The generated per-agent files include the shared OpenViking
endpoint plus tenant-scoped `OPENVIKING_ACCOUNT`, `OPENVIKING_USER`, and
`OPENVIKING_AGENT_ID` values in `agent-<id>.env`, and the matching tenant
`OPENVIKING_API_KEY` in `agent-<id>_secrets.env`. The reserved system backend
also gets `API_SERVER_ENABLED`, `API_SERVER_HOST`, `API_SERVER_PORT`, and a
generated `API_SERVER_KEY` so OpenViking can use it as an OpenAI-compatible
backend. The shared `secrets.env` keeps `OPENVIKING_ROOT_API_KEY`, the shared
embedding API key, and `SMTP_PASSWORD`.
The event handler
`imageroot/events/smarthost-changed/10reload_services` refreshes active agent
targets when cluster smarthost settings change.

`environment` is shared with NS8 core, so module writers must merge their
managed keys instead of overwriting the file. `secrets.env` is reserved for
sensitive values that should not live in the shared environment file, and
`systemd.env` is generated as a controlled subset for the systemd units.

This is the current scaffold behavior and can be replaced if the module grows
beyond the template.

## Uninstall

To uninstall the instance:

    remove-module --no-preserve hermes-agent1

## Testing

Run the module test with:


    ./test-module.sh <NODE_ADDR> ghcr.io/nethserver/hermes-agent:latest

The checked-in test suite is written with [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) and
currently validates shared OpenViking runtime generation, actual runtime status
from `get-configuration`, per-agent target plus runtime container state,
tenant account isolation through the shared OpenViking admin API, named volume
creation, persistence across target restart, stopped-agent runtime cleanup,
reconfiguration cleanup, hidden system-backend behavior, shared embedding
configuration, and module removal.
