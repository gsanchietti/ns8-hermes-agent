# ns8-hermes-agent

`ns8-hermes-agent` is an NS8 module that manages one or more [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/) runtimes.

## Quickstart

Install the module with

```bash
add-module ghcr.io/stell0/hermes-agent:0.2.1 1
```

From the UI, configure:

* a virtualhost for the agent dashboard like `hermes.example.com`
* select a user domain from the dropdown, which binds the module to that domain and populates the `allowed_user` selectors for each agent
* one or more agents with unique `allowed_user` values from the selected user domain

Configuration will create the agents and publish the dashboard at `https://hermes.example.com/` with per-agent authentication and routing.

From dashboard, you can setup a Telegram and everything else, but Dashboard is still early and setting it up from command line is a lot easier.

**Notes**:

* the module does not support multiple agents with the same `allowed_user` value.
* the Dashboard Web UI is build every time the container starts, so it takes a bit of time to be available after the agent service is started.
* after changing the configuration from dashboard, the agent service needs to be restarted to apply the new configuration. At the moment it can be done with the /restart command, but the first time you configure a messaging platform you need to restart the service from terminal with `systemctl --user restart hermes@<id>.service` or saving changes from NS8 ui
* At the moment, saving changes from NS8 UI restart all the agents, but in the future we will implement a smarter logic to restart only the agent that needs it.


## Command line

Not mandatory for normal operation, but first configuration is a lot easier from the command line.

Configure LLM provider and messaging platform for agent #1:
```bash
runagent -m hermes-agent1 podman exec -it hermes-1 hermes setup
```

**Tip**: *If you have OpenAI ChatGPT Plus subscription, you can select OpenAI Codex, than authenticate with OAuth, and the agent will be able to use GPT-5.4 with a shared token that doesn't require per-agent OpenAI API keys.*


Accessing the agent #1 console:
```bash
runagent -m hermes-agent1 podman exec -it hermes-1 hermes
```

See [Hermes Agent documentation](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs) for more details on the available commands and configuration options.

### Other useful commands:

Restart agent #1 from command line
```bash
runagent -m hermes-agent1 systemctl --user restart hermes@1
```

Accessing the agent #3 console:
```bash
runagent -m hermes-agent1 podman exec -it hermes-3 hermes
```

Configure Telegram or other messaging platform for agent #2:
```bash
runagent -m hermes-agent1 podman exec -it hermes-2 hermes gateway setup
```

## Repository guidelines

The current implementation is intentionally small:

- One dedicated Podman pod per configured agent.
- One configured agent maps directly to one metadata file, one generated Hermes env file, one generated Hermes secrets env file under `secrets/`, one per-agent subdir inside the shared `hermes-agents-home` volume, one primary `hermes@<id>.service`, one per-agent pod owner unit, one rootless Podman pod, and one rootless Hermes container that runs the dashboard and gateway together.
- A fresh install is idle until at least one agent is configured with `status: start`.
- `SOUL.md` and the default Hermes home `.env` are seeded exactly once per agent during `configure-module` by a one-shot Hermes container that mounts the shared home volume, the checked-in templates, and the generated public agent env file.
- The module supports at most 30 agents and reserves one TCP port for the shared auth listener.
- The module is now an NS8 account consumer and can bind one shared `user_domain` plus one per-agent `allowed_user` for published dashboard authentication.

## Current behavior

- `create-module` seeds minimal module state in `environment`, `secrets/shared.env`, and `agents/`, records `TIMEZONE`, and discovers smarthost settings.
- `configure-module` validates the submitted agent list plus the shared dashboard virtualhost, optional shared `user_domain`, and optional `lets_encrypt` switch, binds the selected NS8 user domain when set, stores one metadata file per agent, generates per-agent runtime files plus shared auth runtime files, seeds first-time agent home content, reconciles the shared Traefik route, and enables or disables the corresponding `hermes@<id>.service` instances plus the shared `hermes-auth.service` when publishing is active.
- `get-configuration` returns the shared `base_virtualhost`, the shared `user_domain`, the shared `lets_encrypt` setting, and the configured agents with their persisted desired `status` plus `allowed_user`.
- `get-agent-runtime` returns live per-agent `runtime_status` derived from the current systemd service state.
- `destroy-module` stops agent services, removes agent pods and containers, stops the shared auth service, deletes the managed Traefik route, and deletes generated per-agent files plus per-agent Hermes home volumes.
- `discover-smarthost` merges shared SMTP settings into `environment` and `secrets/shared.env`.

## Backup and restore

The module declares its backup scope in `imageroot/etc/state-include.conf`:

```
state/agents
state/secrets
volumes/hermes-agents-home
```

NS8 core uses this file to include the agent metadata, the secrets directory, and the shared home volume in restic snapshots. Derived auth proxy files are intentionally excluded because they can be regenerated from the restored shared environment, agent metadata, and secrets.

After a restore, `restore-module/06copyenv` restores only Hermes-managed shared keys from `request['environment']` (`TIMEZONE`, `BASE_VIRTUALHOST`, `USER_DOMAIN`, `LETS_ENCRYPT`). Then `restore-module/20configure` reads the restored `agents/` tree and reruns `configure-module` so the module rebinds the user domain, regenerates derived runtime files (`agents/<id>/agent.env`, `authproxy.*`), reconciles routes, and recreates the expected services without a manual reconfigure.

## Generated state

Module-wide files:

- `environment`
- `secrets/shared.env`
- `authproxy.env`
- `authproxy_secrets.env`
- `authproxy_agents.json`
- `dashboard-sockets/`

Per-agent files:

- `agents/<id>/metadata.json`
- `agent_<id>.env`
- `secrets/<id>.env`

Shared Podman volume:

- `hermes-agents-home`, with one subdir per agent at `/opt/agents/<id>/`
- bootstrap-managed content inside each agent subdir includes the seeded `SOUL.md`, `.env`, and `config.yaml`, plus the runtime directory skeleton used by Hermes
- ownership is repaired with the Hermes image's own `hermes` UID/GID during updates, so image UID changes do not leave the volume unwritable before the enabled Hermes, socket, and shared auth services are restarted to pick up refreshed images

Operator-visible runtime names are `hermes-pod-<id>` for the pod, `hermes-<id>` for the per-agent Hermes container, `hermes-socket-<id>` for the per-agent socket relay container, `hermes-auth` for the shared auth proxy container, `hermes@.service` for the per-agent primary systemd unit, `hermes-socket@.service` for the per-agent socket sidecar unit, and `hermes-auth.service` for the shared auth unit. The active Traefik route instance is `<module_id>-hermes-auth`, and the shared Hermes home volume name is `hermes-agents-home`.

## Repository layout

- `imageroot/`: NS8 actions, helper scripts, templates, event handler, state helper module, and the user systemd units.
- `containers/`: the Hermes wrapper image sources, the dashboard auth proxy image, and the dashboard socket relay image.
- `ui/`: embedded Vue 2 admin UI.
- `tests/`: Robot Framework integration checks and focused Python unit tests.

See `STRUCTURE.md` for a file map.

## Build

Build the module image, auth proxy image, Hermes wrapper image, and socket relay image with:

```bash
bash build-images.sh
```

The Hermes wrapper image is built from `docker.io/nousresearch/hermes-agent:v2026.4.23`. The wrapper no longer patches or rebuilds dashboard web sources at startup; it bootstraps the Hermes home and points `HERMES_WEB_DIST` at the bundled upstream `web_dist` when present.

The script uses:

- `REPOBASE`, default `ghcr.io/nethserver`
- `IMAGETAG`, default `latest`

## Install

Instantiate the module with:

```bash
add-module ghcr.io/nethserver/hermes-agent:latest 1
```

Example output:

```json
{"module_id": "hermes-agent1", "image_name": "hermes-agent", "image_url": "ghcr.io/nethserver/hermes-agent:latest"}
```

No agent is created during install.

## Configure

The `configure-module` payload accepts a shared `base_virtualhost`, an optional shared `user_domain`, an optional shared `lets_encrypt` boolean, and an `agents` array.

`base_virtualhost` is optional. When set, Traefik publishes one shared auth entrypoint on `https://<base_virtualhost>/`, and the shared auth service routes each authenticated session to its assigned running agent dashboard.
Submit an empty value to remove all managed dashboard routes.

`user_domain` is optional while dashboard publishing is disabled. When `base_virtualhost` is set and at least one agent exists, `user_domain` becomes required and must match an NS8 user domain visible through `agent.ldapproxy`.

`lets_encrypt` is optional. When `true`, Traefik requests a Let's Encrypt certificate for the shared dashboard host. The flag applies to the shared host, not to individual agents.
Changing the shared host, clearing it, or turning `lets_encrypt` off makes the module update or remove the managed routes and request any needed certificate cleanup on the Traefik side.

Each agent contains:

- `id`: integer starting from `1` and capped at `30`
- `name`: letters and spaces only
- `role`: one of `default`, `developer`, `marketing`, `sales`, `customer_support`, `social_media_manager`, `business_consultant`, or `researcher`
- `status`: `start` or `stop`
- `allowed_user`: bare username from the selected NS8 `user_domain`; required when `base_virtualhost` is set and at least one agent is published, and must be unique across the published agent set

Example:

```bash
api-cli run module/hermes-agent1/configure-module --data '{"base_virtualhost":"agents.example.org","user_domain":"example.org","lets_encrypt":true,"agents":[{"id":1,"name":"Foo Bar","role":"developer","status":"start","allowed_user":"alice"}]}'
```

That configuration will:

- store `agents/1/metadata.json`
- generate `agent_1.env` and `agent_1_secrets.env`
- bind the module to the selected NS8 user domain and validate `allowed_user` against that domain
- run a one-shot `podman run --entrypoint /bin/sh` seed step that mounts `hermes-agents-home:/opt/agents`, mounts the checked-in templates at `/templates`, and creates `/opt/agents/1/SOUL.md` plus `/opt/agents/1/.env` only when they do not already exist
- create or update the shared Traefik route for `https://agents.example.org/`
- enable and start `hermes@1.service`
- enable and start `hermes-socket@1.service`
- create one rootless Podman pod, `hermes-pod-1`, containing the Hermes container `hermes-1`, which binds the dashboard to `127.0.0.1:9120` and runs the gateway together, plus the relay container `hermes-socket-1`, which exposes `/sockets/agent-1.sock`
- enable and start the shared auth proxy service `hermes-auth.service` when publishing is active

Read the current configuration with:

```bash
api-cli run module/hermes-agent1/get-configuration --data '{}'
```

Example output:

```json
{"base_virtualhost": "agents.example.org", "user_domain": "example.org", "lets_encrypt": true, "agents": [{"id": 1, "name": "Foo Bar", "role": "developer", "status": "start", "allowed_user": "alice"}]}
```

`status` is the persisted desired state.

Read live runtime state with:

```bash
api-cli run module/hermes-agent1/get-agent-runtime --data '{}'
```

Example output:

```json
{"agents": [{"id": 1, "runtime_status": "start"}]}
```

`runtime_status` is derived from the actual systemd service state.

## Accessing the dashboard

If `base_virtualhost` is configured, `https://<base_virtualhost>/` is the primary shared entrypoint.
The shared auth service authenticates against the shared `user_domain`, maps the authenticated username to exactly one assigned running agent, and proxies the rest of that session's requests to the selected dashboard.
`https://<base_virtualhost>/hermes-N/` remains an auth-owned login or session-status page for agent `N`; it is no longer a Traefik path route to the dashboard itself.
The auth proxy logs `auth_attempt`, `auth_success`, `auth_failed`, and `proxy_failed` events to standard output for troubleshooting published dashboard access. When `DEBUG=1` or `AUTH_PROXY_DEBUG=1`, it also logs `request_received` for inbound requests and `proxy_forward` with the resolved upstream URL before forwarding. If the assigned dashboard upstream is temporarily unavailable, the proxy returns HTTP 502 instead of terminating the app.

## Runtime unit

The shipped user units are `imageroot/systemd/user/hermes@.service`, `imageroot/systemd/user/hermes-socket@.service`, `imageroot/systemd/user/hermes-auth.service`, and `imageroot/systemd/user/hermes-pod@.service`.

Each started agent runs:

- one primary `systemctl --user` service instance: `hermes@<id>.service`
- one per-agent socket relay service instance: `hermes-socket@<id>.service`
- one Podman pod: `hermes-pod-<id>`
- one Hermes container: `hermes-<id>`
- one socket relay container: `hermes-socket-<id>`
- one Podman-managed subdir at `/opt/agents/<id>/` inside the shared `hermes-agents-home` volume
- one per-agent dashboard socket at `%S/state/dashboard-sockets/agent-<id>.sock`, mounted into `hermes-auth` as `/sockets/agent-<id>.sock`

Shared publishing also runs:

- one shared Traefik route instance: `<module_id>-hermes-auth`
- one shared auth listener on `127.0.0.1:${TCP_PORT}` forwarded to auth proxy port `9119`
- one shared auth proxy service instance: `hermes-auth.service`
- one shared Hermes dashboard auth container: `hermes-auth`

Restart supervision is owned by the systemd user units; `hermes@<id>.service` uses `Restart=always` so in-agent `/restart` messages can cycle the gateway, while sidecar/auth services use failure-oriented restart policies. Podman pod and container launches do not set container-level restart policies.
The shipped services mount the shared `hermes-agents-home` volume at `/opt/agents`, with `HERMES_HOME=/opt/agents/<id>` set per agent.
Managed `SOUL.md` and home `.env` seeding runs before service start in `configure-module/75seed-agent-home`; later agent edits preserve existing files inside the volume.
The Hermes container reads `agent_<id>.env` and `secrets/<id>.env`, mounts the shared home volume, and runs `hermes gateway run` inside the pod. The per-agent socket sidecar relays that listener onto `%S/state/dashboard-sockets/agent-<id>.sock`. The shared auth proxy container reads `authproxy.env`, `authproxy_secrets.env`, and `authproxy_agents.json`, mounts `%S/state/dashboard-sockets:/sockets:z`, authenticates the shared route against LDAP, preserves the dashboard upstream `Authorization` header, injects a trusted `X-Hermes-Authenticated-User` header derived from the authenticated session username while ignoring any client-supplied value for that header, logs auth events to stdout, and proxies requests to the assigned per-agent `upstream_socket`.
If `base_virtualhost` is set, Traefik forwards `https://<base_virtualhost>/` directly to the shared auth proxy listener. No per-agent path route, `strip_prefix`, or `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header is required.

## UI development

The embedded UI lives in `ui/`.

For local UI work:

```bash
cd ui
yarn install
yarn serve
```

For a production bundle:

```bash
cd ui
yarn install
yarn build
```

If required by your environment, set `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` before running the UI toolchain.

## Testing

Run the module test with:

```bash
./test-module.sh <NODE_ADDR> ghcr.io/nethserver/hermes-agent:latest
```

The checked-in tests cover the pruned contract:

- install produces no active agent runtime
- zero agents keeps the module idle
- one started agent produces one pod, three services, two containers, one auth-proxied route with the configured shared TLS mode, one isolated volume, and one isolated generated file set
- stopping an agent disables the runtime without deleting its generated files or volume
- removing an agent cleans the runtime files and volume
- removing the module cleans the instance state

## Uninstall

Remove the instance with:

```bash
remove-module --no-preserve hermes-agent1
```
